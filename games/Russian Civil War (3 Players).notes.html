			<br/>Artillery provides +1 attack support for 4 allied infantry/cavalry.
			<br/>Machine guns shot at up to 4 infantry/cavalry with a 1/3 chance to kill in the first combat round when defending. Number of shots can not be more than one for each enemy infantry/cavalry, even if there are more machine guns available.
			<br/>Tachankas have the same ability as machine guns, except that they fire when attacking, not defending.
			<br/>Tanks and armored trains give -1 penalty to attack and defence for 2 and 4 enemy units, respectively. Each enemy unit can get at most one -1 penalty.

			<br><br><b>Game and history</b>
		</div>
		<div style="text-align:left;font-size:100%;background-color:B4A698">
			<br>The conflict the game is based on was a multi-sided conflict with dozens of different interest groups, separatist movements and intervening foreign powers. Frontlines were constantly changing. This, coupled with the lack of information, makes it really hard to get an accurate picture of the conflict. The game assumes a starting setup around 1918, featuring a very limited number of belligerents, with borders drawn in a way which is closer to what makes an interesting gameplay than to what is historically reasonable.
			<br>As far as unit selection is concerned, it represents the actual warfare. Unit stats were devised mostly with gameplay purposes in mind. Unit availability to factions is based on history.
			<br>The territory names are historically accurate, always using the Russian name even if an English equivalent is available (e.g. Saint Petersburg). Impassable territories are to be ignored. Production values are very loosely based on development.
			<br>
			<br>A few sidenotes: The Siberian part of the map is seriously distorted to save space. Tanks in this time period were huge, slow moving fortresses, unlike their fast ww2 counterparts. The train network was very well developed to allow free movement for armored trains, except for northern Siberia, but that can be ignored from gameplay perspective. Both the Red and White armies had something of what remained of the Imperial Russian Army, so they both had access to planes. The amount of artillery support doesn't represent the strength of artillery, but rather the desired optimal ratio of artillery to infantry, similar goes for other units. The tachanka was a unique unit widely used in the civil war, originally by the Black Army, but it is only available to certain factions as it is unclear whether it was used by whites too. Armored trains and tanks are the typical two-hit units, but the two-hit machanics encourages massed hit-and-run tactics, which tanks and armored trains were certainly not used for.
